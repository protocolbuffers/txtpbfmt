# Text Proto Formatter

`txtpbfmt` parses, edits and formats text proto files in a way that preserves comments.

This saves development (read/edit/review) time and enables automated edits.

```shell
$ go get -u github.com/protocolbuffers/txtpbfmt/cmd/txtpbfmt
```

Format files in-place:

```shell
$ ${GOPATH}/bin/txtpbfmt [FILES]
```

Write formatted input to stdout:

```

## Is there an API to edit text proto files while preserving comments?

## How to disable it?

You can disable formatting for a whole file by adding a comment with "#
txtpbfmt: disable" to the top of the file (before the first non-empty
non-comment line), eg:

```textproto
# File overview ...

# txtpbfmt: disable

content: { ... }
```

## Which file extension should I use for my text proto files?

The `.textproto` extension is the most used extension inside Google (the second
most popular choice is `.textpb`).

## Which tools support it? How to format on save?

Currently there is no open source integration with any editor.
